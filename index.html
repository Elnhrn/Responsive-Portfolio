                Hi, I'm Elaine and I am an aspiring developer. I was raised in Philadelphia and have lived in Idaho, Utah, Los Angeles, and now live in Sacramento with my 5-year-old son. During the day, I work from home as an affiliate marketing
                specialist for a comparison shopping engine website. At night, I tackle motherhood and try not to step on rogue Legos (unsuccessfully.)

                In my spare time, you can usually find me hanging out with my son and my boyfriend and his dog. I love reading! One year
                I read 87 books - not including picture books! I also enjoy lifting, riding my bike, EDM, dancing, Netflix, and knitting and crocheting. I try to live a sustainable lifestyle by bringing my own containers and produce bags to the grocery store and limiting the purchase of packaged goods.
